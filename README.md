# snackoverflow

snackoverflow is an app that reduces food waste while introducing a cheaper solution for groceries. The ultimate win-win.
## The Cause

In Canada $31 billion worth of food is thrown out every month from grocery stores and restaurants, adding up to nearly 40% of food
produced within our nation.
The two main deterrents for companies to donate food lies in **logistics** and **liability**, both of which snackoverflow looks to solve.

### Logistics

Many times, stores do not have the available space to store their leftover food before agencies can pick it up. In other cases,
food banks are unable to transport and store highly perishable foods.

**Snackoverflow provides a platform that takes stress away from the companny, and brings the consumer to _them_ instead.** 

### Liability

Many vendors mistakenly believe that they will be liable if their food gets a consumer sick, even when they believe the food is 
perfectly fine. They may decide that donating the food isn't worth the legal risk. 
According to Ontario's Donation of Food Act, the vendor is, in fact, not liable!

**Snackoverflow removes the stigma by preserving the ligitimacy brought along by transactional business while still following a 
philanthopic model.**

## How It Works

Flash sales are sales where prices are greatly reduced, though only last for a short period of time. 
The largest issue regarding flash sales is the lack of exposure. Pairing with grocery stores and restaurants,
**snackoverflow push out real-time notifications for massive flash-sales to instantly generate interest to all app-users in the area.**
